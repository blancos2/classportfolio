    <h1>Email Exchange With Someone From 1995</h1>
    <i>A young person from 1995 stumbled upon a strange website that claims to send emails to the future. They're skeptical that it's real, but they see an email address, so they decide to play along. Miraculously their email arrives in your inbox. Write a short email exchange with this person from 1995. Explain to them how the internet, society and culture have change since 1995. Focus on details of daily internet use (e.g., projects, music, websites, or social habits), and the cultural differences in how the internet is perceived and used. </i>

   <p>Hello, curious stranger! I know you are likely just as surprised as I am that this email exchange works, but that means I can share the wealth of information about our current technology! 

 

    In the year 2025, internet and computer access is very commonplace. For the most part, it’s rather affordable. It has shaped our culture and the way we interact with the world. People like to share information about themselves, or their lives- usually in short form content. In jokes on the internet quickly circulate and can result in trends spreading across the globe like wildfire. 
    
    In some cases, it replaced traditional news outlets… but this isnt always for the better. While most everyone has easy access to most information, not always is that information accurate… People have built up some bad habits of scrolling quickly without fact checking, which can result in misinformation being circulated. 
    
    Speaking of tech… our computer capabilities have advanced considerable leaps and bounds. Websites can offer so many interesting interactions, or stylish displays! All very fun to explore through! 
    
    the rise of the internet has had quite the impact on culture and people today. I wonder if that comes as a surprise to you, curious stranger. Despite its flaws, i think there is a lot of good to be found online.
