    <h1>Web Accessibility Training</h1>

   <i>In a short paragraph, explain what you learned from the digital accessibility training. Did the training make you think differently about the design of (digital) technologies? </i>
  <p>As someone who is able bodied, I am fortunate to not have to worry about technologies having to accommodate for me, because in many cases, i am the 'default'. But disabilities come in many forms, and those with disabilities deserve to also use the technologies available, like everyone else.
For those who use screen readers, having a lack of image descriptions can result in a page of content that is mainly inaccessible. I know it also is a struggle at times for those image id's to provide meaningful information. In the wild i've encountered many images that are untagged or unmarked for strobing lights. What is a minor inconvenience to me can be a massive barrier to someone else.

Making the web an accessible place for everyone requires that you not only be aware of the various different ways others may interact and use the technology, but also go through the effort of accommodating them.</p>
