    <h1>Unplugging for 24 hours</h1>

   <p>This assignment was an interesting one, to say the least - as someone who spends a lot of their free time on screens of some kind, it was a challenge to figure out what to do, at first. Often times, I spend the start of my day on my phone, doing my game dailies. But in the spirit of following through on that assignment, I had to forsake a day of game dailies. The temptation was very, very hard to resist, given it was part of my routine. 

    I found myself getting pulled by the boredom pretty early in - the itch to fill the idle time with spotify or scrolling. Even as I pulled out a book and instead tried to focus on that instead, I kept getting that itch to do more, get that stimulation. I found that using that boredom helped motivate me to do more engaging tasks, such as some clay work, studying for math, or chatting with roommates. While initially it felt like time was passing super slowly, after getting into the grove of working on things it gradually eased out. By the end of it, I felt less monumentally bored as I had when I started, calmer, even. I might try this again sometime, I think unplugging is something I could benefit from doing every now and then...
